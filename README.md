    # Book: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius

    # Quote from above book: 

    “Concentrate every minute like a Roman—like a man—on

doing what’s in front of you with precise and genuine

seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing

yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can—if you do

everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your

life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions

override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical,

self-centered, irritable. You see how few things you have to

do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage

this, that’s all even the gods can ask of you.”
